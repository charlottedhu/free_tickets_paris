# Free tickets (let's dream)
## A study of potential gratuity in the parisian subway
### 📝 Summary & objective
I made this analysis along with 3 other teammates at Le Wagon. This is the final project we presented on our last day in front of all the bootcamp participants. We played the role of external consultants that make recommendations to Ile-de-France Mobilités (IDFM), aka the entity that manages public transportation in the region.  

Our objective was to assess the consequences of partial / complete gratuity in the parisian subway. 
We chose 3 axis to develop our analysis : peak periods, budget and environment:
- 👫 <ins>**Peak periods**:</ins> how can gratuity impact rush hours and frequentation ? Can IDFM absorb the extra passengers ? **Main KPI : number of validations**
- 💰 <ins>**Budget**:</ins> How much will the shortfall cost if IDFM does not sell any more tickets ? What is the best strategy between partial or total gratuity ? **Main KPI: estimation of the loss of income**
- 🌱 <ins>**Environment**:</ins> Can we estimate the impact of gratuity on CO2 emissions in the Paris area ? **Main KPI: tons of CO2 emissions**
